Chemical Equipment Parameter VisualizerHybrid Web and Desktop Analytics PlatformThis project is a unified analytics tool designed to monitor chemical equipment parameters across different platforms. It features a single Django backend that serves both a modern React web dashboard and a native PyQt5 desktop application.How the Hybrid System WorksThe core of this project is a shared API. This ensures data consistency and real-time updates across environments:Shared Data: Any data uploaded through the desktop app is immediately available on the web dashboard via the central database.Unified Logic: Analytics logic is powered by Pandas, ensuring that statistics like average pressure and temperature are identical on both platforms.History Sync: Both frontends track the last 5 datasets stored in a shared SQLite database.Technology StackComponentTechnologyBackendDjango & Django REST FrameworkWeb FrontendReact.js & Chart.jsDesktop FrontendPyQt5 & MatplotlibData ProcessingPandasReportingReportLab (PDF Generation)Key FeaturesSmart CSV Parsing: Automatically detects equipment names, types, flowrate, pressure, and temperature from raw files.Dual Visualizations: Interactive equipment distribution charts using Chart.js (Web) and Matplotlib (Desktop).History Management: Built-in logic to automatically store and display the last 5 uploads for quick access.PDF Export: Generate professional, individual summary reports for any upload in your history list.Setup Instructions1. PrerequisitesPython 3.9 or higherNode.js (for the React dashboard)2. Backend and Desktop SetupOpen your terminal in the root project folder:Activate virtual environment:Windows: venv\Scripts\activateMac/Linux: source venv/bin/activateInstall dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txtPrepare database: python manage.py migrateStart API: python manage.py runserver3. Web Frontend SetupOpen a second terminal:Navigate to folder: cd frontendInstall packages: npm installStart dashboard: npm run dev4. Running the Desktop AppOpen a third terminal (with your virtual environment active):Run command: python desktop_app.pySample DataA file named sample_equipment_data.csv is included in the main folder. Use this file for initial testing to see how the system parses and visualizes parameters.
